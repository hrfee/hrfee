### Hi

A CS student in the UK. Currently doing:
* [jellyfin-accounts](https://github.com/hrfee/jellyfin-accounts): A better way to manage accounts for [Jellyfin](https://jellyfin.org/). Started this out of quarantine boredom, as well as to learn a bit of basic web development and brush up on my python skills. 
* [jfa-go](https://github.com/hrfee/jellyfin-accounts): jellyfin-accounts, but less stable and written in Golang. Again, done out of boredom, but also to learn a new language.

i use arch, btw.
