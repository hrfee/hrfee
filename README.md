### Hi

A CS student in the UK. Stuff i've done:
* [jfa-go](https://github.com/hrfee/jfa-go) (jellyfin-accounts go): A user management app for [Jellyfin](https://jellyfin.org)/[Emby](https://emby.media/), with features like invites, automated password resets, and new user profiles. This is a rewrite of my quarantine project [jellyfin-accounts](https://github.com/hrfee/jellyfin-accounts) in Go and Typescript instead of Python and Javascript.
* [buildrone](https://github.com/hrfee/buildrone): An app for publicly hosting software builds from Drone CI. Very janky, but useful for doing nightly releases for my software. See [here](https://builds.hrfee.pw/view/hrfee/jfa-go) for a running instance.
* [waybar-mpris](https://git.hrfee.pw/hrfee/waybar-mpris): Waybar component/utility for displaying and controlling MPRIS2 music players individually.
* [go-scrobble](https://git.hrfee.pw/hrfee/waybar-mpris): Personal Last.FM scrobbler for MPRIS2 players, using the same [mpris2client](https://github.com/hrfee/mpris2client) library I wrote for waybar-mpris.

I also host some things on my gitea instance [here](https://git.hrfee.pw).
