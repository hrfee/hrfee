### Hi

A CS student in the UK. Stuff i've done:
* [jellyfin-accounts](https://github.com/hrfee/jellyfin-accounts): A better way to manage accounts for [Jellyfin](https://jellyfin.org/). Started this out of quarantine boredom, as well as to learn a bit of basic web development and brush up on my python skills. 
* [jfa-go](https://github.com/hrfee/jfa-go): jellyfin-accounts, but less stable and written in Golang. Again, done out of boredom, but also to learn a new language.
* [waybar-mpris](https://git.hrfee.pw/hrfee/waybar-mpris): Waybar component/utility for displaying and controlling MPRIS2 music players individually.

I've moved a lot of stuff over to a gitea instance [here](https://git.hrfee.pw), so check it out.
